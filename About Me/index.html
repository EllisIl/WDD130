      About Me
    </h1>

    <p>
      My name is Elijah Foard and I am from South Riding, Virginia. 
      I am going to be studying Software Engineering and I like working 
      with computers and have worked with them all my life. I am not married
      and don't have any children that I know of. The last job I had was 
      working in a East Coast grocery store calles Harris Teeter where I 
      worked as a cashier during night shifts. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I am going to complete my bachelor's degree here at BYU-Idaho and may transfer to another college
      to complete a masters degree. BYU-Idaho is such a unique place since 
      the dressing standards here are much higher than other colleges.
      I am doing this course as a requirement but am also interested in 
      learning HTML and CSS so I can design websites and show friends what 
      is possible with coding. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I have been a member of the Church of Jesus
      Christ of Latter Day Saints throughout my entire life. My favorite 
      scripture is likely common and is in Doctrine and Covenants 6:36 and states
      "Look unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not."
